# K-Robust
This is the first program I ever wrote in python. The code is somewhat messy and disorganized, but I don't want to change it. This may be updated with alternative files that are more versitile and clean, but the original file will stay up.

This reads in .json files of agent descriptions then builds teams of agents that are k-robust. That is, any 'k' agents can be removed and all the tasks can still be completed. Included are mutiple algorithms of my design as well as the 'greedy' algorithm detailed in 'Evaluating the Efficiency of Robust Team Formation Algorithms.' from 2016. Also the code supports easily adding and testing new algorithms.
